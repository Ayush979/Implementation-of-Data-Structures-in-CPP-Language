# Understand-and-implement-Data-Structures-using-CPP-
This project is related to the concept of Data Structures(Queues,Stacks,Trees,Linked Lists) in C++. Here in this project we will be understanding about these data structures in C++ by taking some inputs  from user and performing inserting and displaying these values using some functions of these data structures.

##Software Requirements:

1.Dev C++(Application installed on windows)
download link of this application on windows:https://bloodshed-dev-c.en.softonic.com/

----------------------------------------
##Purpose of this project:

The main purpose is help new beginners understand the concept these data structure in C++ such as insertion and display operation.
In this program we have used some of the Abstract Data Type(ADT) in C++. 
The main purpose of using abstract data type in code is that by using abstract data types our burden of 
load goes off. 
The operations such as Transversal, Insertion, Deletion can be carried out in such a manner that it does not require much of the code compiling.

The basic ADTs are:
1-QUEUES
2-STACKS
3-LINKED LIST
4-TREE
these Data Structures are used in this project.

----------------------------------------
##Functionality of the project:

For running the program you can use DEV-C++ IDEs.
After running this program firstly you need to enter the inputs, for giving the input here are some keys you need to use are:

Press 1-can give your first name as input
Press 2-can be used to give your last name
Press 3-you can enter your age
Press 4-can enter year of birth
Press 5-It can be used to start the printing
Press 6-And this can be used to exit the program at any position                   

This program provides you the flexibility to use any of the above keys ant any
position of the program until we start printing. No.6 can be used to exit while
printing too, this can be used to exit the program at any position.


Keys used while printing are:
7-Press 7 to print in order using Queue
8-Press 8 to print in reverse order using Stack
9-Press 9 to print in order using inorder tree traversal
10-Press 10 to print in Preorder using preorder tree traversal
11-Press 11 to print in Postorder using postorder tree traversal
12-Press 12 to print the data using linked list
   then after sorting the values it prints again
13-Press 13 to sort the values.
-1-Press -1 to keep processing and to enter new data
*if by mistake you press the wrong input then you have chance to enter the input again.

This code provide you a benefit of using it again and again by giving infite 
number of inputs. Or you can press 0 to stop the program right there.

----------------------------------------
##TROUBLESHOOTING:

If the program does not runs then you need to check the keys used while giving your
input, if certain other keys are used by mistake you will not be able to give input 
or start printing.
